### 👋 Hi, I’m @suhquk [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=github&label=GitHub&labelColor=495867&color=495867&query=%24.data.totalSubs&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.spencerwoo.com%2Fsubstats%2F%3Fsource%3Dgithub%26queryKey%3Dsuhquk&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/suhquk)


👀 I’m interested in computer programming, specifically in areas like software development, web development, and data structures. I have a passion for understanding how things work behind the interfaces that we interact with on a daily basis.

🌱 I’m currently learning front-end and back-end development technologies. I'm diving deep into languages like JavaScript for front-end and Node.js, Python for back-end. I'm also learning about databases, and how to build and interact with APIs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, specifically those focused on improving web performance and user experience. I am also open to working on innovative projects that aim to solve real-world problems.

📫 How to reach me: You can reach me via my email at 2282481204@qq.com. Feel free to contact me if you have any opportunities, need help with a project, or just want to chat about programming!
